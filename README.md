## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
By first asking what the user wants, I can break their wants into what neeeds to be delivered. User stories help by presenting the goal from the viewpoint of the user: "As a user, I want to be able to..." 
## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I will need to take more time to understand the intent of an application from the user's point of view as I plan a project. When working on a team, I will suggest the use of the daily scrum meeting, it seems a good way to keep a team on the same page while preventing drawn out talks that may not apply to all the team members.
## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Open communication is perhaps the most important part of being a good team member. Keeping the the rest of the team updated on what you are working on, what progress you've made all help the team stay in sync and maintain momentum. Being open about blockers and issues gives the team the chance to offer solutions or quickly change course.
